# Quantum-Walks-and-Quantum-Monte-Carlo
The Quantum Galton Board (QGB) is capable of simulating statistical distributions, and is used to model complex random processes, and solve differential equations. This project enables the generation of QGBs which simulate (1) normal (2) exponential (3) quantum Hadamard random walk distributions.
